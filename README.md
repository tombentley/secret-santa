# secret-santa

A simple python script for doing a 'Secret Santa', where each of a bunch of 
people are given a secret Christmas gift by one of the others. 

Using the program should mean:

* No one needs to coordinate who is buying for whom 
* The person running the script won't even know the assignments (unless they 
  check their 'sent items')
* Santas are assigned pseudo-randomly

It's even possible to add 'exclusions' to avoid certain people from having to 
buy from each other, for example.

## Documentation
